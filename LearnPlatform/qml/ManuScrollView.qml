/*
   PhxScrollView extends the scrollbar example by having the scrollbar handles automatically show on mouseover
   in addition to showing while scrolling. The handles will be visible for a minimum of 2 seconds once made to
   show thanks to the addition of a Timer.

   In order to make PhxScrollView reusable, a Flickable property is exposed which, by default, is assigned to the last
   child of this object. In practice, this means that all you need to do is make sure the last child of your
   PhxScrollView is a Flickable.
