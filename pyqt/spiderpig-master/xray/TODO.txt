TODO for X-Ray simulator

Bugs
* If no connection, gui input does not appear in log list

Features needed now:
* Quickly switch between codec and simulator without going through menus, dialogs etc
* Show status of message (sent from gui, received by codec et)
* Show which GUI and codec is connected in a intuitive way (boxes and connections)
* Improve connection handlings. Quit proxy if no comms. Timeout codec pairing
* Improve handling non-existing file directories
* Setup guide on wiki
* Warn if no files in simulator dir.

Future features:
* Built-in help system (html / Qt Assistant)
* Recently used codecs
* Warning if not able to connect to codec. Also, hint about codec password and prompt
* First-time help
* Built in text search here and there
* View contents of xml file and/or xml data. separate view/tool

Code improvements:
* automate testing for the step above for client->simulator (with sample xml files)
* the division btw the two projects. change to xray, and xrayproxy or something

Done:
* Set directory for simulator, and remember last used
* GUI for starting and stopping recording. Indicate that you are recording. Select output folder
* Add message counter to list (but should it be the same as ocean's message id?)
* Switch off results from codec (but still show them in gui and allow to modify and send back answer)
* Move all stuff from menu bar to toolbar in main window, too hard to find on linux and mac
* Turn on/off filtering of periodic messages
* When clicking command, show that in message window

Fixed:
* Sending data to gui from file with more than one reply only lists the first reply in the reply list
(but it's still sent correctly, and shown in the message content view)
* When connected to codec, show that in the connection dialog
* When moving up/down list with keys, show message in message editor as well
* When selecting more than one message, clear message window
