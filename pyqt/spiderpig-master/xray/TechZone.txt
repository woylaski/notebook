Stuff to present


Part 1:
Introduction to xapi
- what it is
- how to access it
- how to get help (completion, schema commands, documentation, developers)
- status, config and commands. what's the difference
- lists
- how to setup a call
- how to listen to changes (feedback)
- how to change audio volume
- how to quit

Benefits of the xapi

Drawbacks

Part 3:

Reasons for usage:
* work offline
* situations that take time to setup (eight calls on hold)
* hardware thats difficult to get hold of (moody)
* api that is agreed upon but not finished implemented on codec
* sniffing tool. debug. or just learning
* stuff that needs complex external setup. cucm (consultative add)
* stuff that is _not_ preferable to test for real (plugging in / out monitor cable)
* switching btw many different setups, vcses regularly
* pms, marketing etc who needs screenshots
* integrators?
* remote teams without network access / resources. kepler team


Architecture
* Diagram of connection types: gui to simulator, gui to codec, gui to manual
gui to codec with manual modification of feedback
* Show server/proxy nature of connection. explain how ocean pairs (in host mode).
explain why it is easy to modify to pralines

* Explain the disposable nature. Explain why (api changing often)
* Run through recording. Pair with codec, make a call,

* Translation. generation of screens. use exisiting scripts??

* If possible, show xray being used with:
Ocean
Pralines
Phoenix
Web gui
Or explain how this can be added easily

* Limitations. Explain why

* Future extension:
Web server allowing actual simulation. xapi converted to json for easy manipulation

* Brainstorming in groups of 5 persons: Do we like tools like this? What more could they be used for? Or other users?
Other nice features?

* Note about promoting playtime
