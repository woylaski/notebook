IRCLIB
==================================================


Here's a quick overview of irclib:


irclib.py:
	class IRC - basic irc client (might  contain more than one server connection). You can attach event handlers to it. Contains ref to 

	class Connection - abstract base class

	class ServerConnection - inherits Connection. Contains all the interesting irc calls such as join, kick, ping, privmsg, sendraw etc

	class SimpleIRCClient - no inheritance. Enables on_xxx event handler functions that can be implemented by subclasses for actual use. 
	Contains ref to ircobj and connection obj

ircbot.py:
	class SingleServerIRCBot - inherits SimpleIRCClient. Adds automatic reconnection if disconnected. Keeps track of channels and connected users




May be needed by plugins:
- Able to send channel / direct message on own choice
- List of available users
- IRC basic commands: WHOIS, WHOWAS, ....
- Attach event handler (on_join etc)
- Send raw (kick, op, ...)
- Restart service
- Start spiderpig with different server/port/channel/nick
- Metadata: server/port/channel/nick
