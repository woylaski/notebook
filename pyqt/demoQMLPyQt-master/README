Demonstrate Qt QML with PyQt

Example how-to use Qt QML and Qt Quick Controls with PyQt.

I have a QtWidgets app.
I want to test these issues:
- will QML fix style issues on mobile platforms:  QtWidgets does not have native style on iOS.
- what widgets are missing in QML: form dialog and share sheet/button
- what architectures work (nesting QML in QWidget or vice versa)

This project has several qml files that demo:
- many built-in widgets (Quick controls)
- a model (a Component) defined in Python
- signals between QML and Python (back and forth)
- architectures: nesting QML inside a QWidget (but reverse is not possible in Qt Quick 2 in Qt 5 ? but is Qt Quick 1 still in Qt 5?

Versions
--------

I don't know of a good process for keeping up-to-date on QtQuick versions.
I think you must do global search and replace to update the versions in your QML code.

This uses the latest versions for Qt5.4?:
QtQuick 2.4
Controls 1.3
Dialogs 1.2
Layouts 1.1


Dependency
----------
Now this project depends on my other github project qtEmbeddedQmlFramework.
In other words, I moved some of the boilerplate code from this project to qtEmbeddedQmlFramework.
Especially the code for finding .qml file in resources directory.
In anticipation of testing pyqtdeployed apps (where frozen code AND resources are compiled into one embedded .qrc file system.)


Compatibility with pyqtdeploy and mobile platforms
--------------------------------------------------
In progress: testing pyqtdeploy'ed on mobile platforms (iOS and Android) using touch


TODO
----
- test iOS and Android for style conformance
- test whether QML dialogs nested in QWidget are full screen on mobile platforms
- Use pyrcc to put the qml in resources
- pyqtdeploy it


Status
------
much cruft from failed experiments.  Probably fragile.  Not necessarily architecturally correct.
