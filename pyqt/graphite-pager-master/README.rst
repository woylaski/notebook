==============
Graphite Pager
==============

Graphite is a great tool for recording metrics but it isn't easy to get paged
when a metric passes a certain threshold.

Graphite-Pager is an easy to use alerting tool for Graphite that will send
notification alerts if a metric reaches a warning or critical level.

Requirements
============

* Python 2.6+
* Graphite
* Redis
* libmagic

Installation
============

Using PIP:

From Github::

    pip install git+git://github.com/seatgeek/graphite-pager.git@0.1.2#egg=graphite-pager

From PyPI::

    pip install graphite-pager==0.0.10

Running
=======

At the moment the easiest way to install Graphite-Pager is with Heroku! See
the example at https://github.com/philipcristiano/graphite-pager-heroku-example.

1. Set Environment variables:

   .. code:: bash

       export GRAPHITE_USER=HTTP-basic username
       export GRAPHITE_PASS=HTTP-basic password
       export GRAPHITE_URL=HTTPS(hopefully) URL to your Graphite installation
       export PAGERDUTY_KEY=Specific PagerDuty application key
       export REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/
       # REDISTOGO_URL is also supported

2. Set up alerts in the ``alerts.yml`` file
3. Run ``graphite-pager``:

   .. code:: bash

       graphite-pager --config alerts.yml

Where the file ``alerts.yml`` is in the following format.

Environment variables can also be specified in the yaml file at the top level. Simply change the casing of the environment variable to lowercase like so:

.. code:: yaml

    redis_url: "redis://localhost:6379/"

Configuration of Alerts
=======================

Configuration of alerts is handled by a YAML file. This can be verified with

.. code:: bash

    graphite-pager verfify --config=config.yml

If it's invalid graphite-pager will likely crash.

Notifiers
---------

Notifiers are what communicate with your preferred alerting service. Currently
Graphite-Pager supports PagerDuty, HipChat and PushBullet notifications.

PagerDuty requires an application key set in the environment as ``PAGERDUTY_KEY``

HipChat requires an application key ``HIPCHAT_KEY`` and the room to notify ``HIPCHAT_ROOM``

Slack requires an slack ``SLACK_URL``.

PushBullet requires an application key ``PUSHBULLET_KEY`` and optionally
comma separated list of devices in ``PUSHBULLET_DEVICES`` and/or comma
separated list of contacts in ``PUSHBULLET_CONTACTS``.

More notifiers are easy to write, file an issue if there is something you would like!

Documentation url
-----------------

An attribute of ``docs\_uls`` in the configuration will add a link to the
documentation of the alert. Currently this is in the format of
``{docs\_url}/{alert name}#{alert legend name}``

Alert Format
------------

Alerts have 4 required arguments and 2 optional arguments.

Required arguments:

* name - Name of thie alert group
* warning - Int for a warning value
* critical - Int for a critical value
* target - Graphtie metric to check, best if aliased

Graphite Pager understands the values for warning and critical in order to
check < and >. If warning is less than critical, values above either will
trigger an alert. If warning is greater than critical than lower values will
trigger the alert.

.. code::

    Example:

        Warning: 1
        Critical: 2

        0 is fine, 3 will be critical

        Warning: 2
        Critical: 1

        0 is critical, 3 is fine.

Optional argument:

- from - The Graphite `from` parameter for how long to query for ex. ``-10min`` default ``-1min``.
- exclude - A list of targets to include. This must match the full target so it is recommended that you use the Graphite function ``alias()`` to make these readable.

Ordering of Alerts
------------------

Alerts with the same name and target will only be checked once! This is useful
if you want to have a subset of metrics with different check times and/or
values

.. code:: yaml

    - name: Load
      target: aliasByNode(servers.worker-*.loadavg01,1)
      warning: 10
      critical: 20

    - name: Load
      target: aliasByNode(servers.*.loadavg01,1)
      warning: 5
      critical: 10

In the above example, any ``worker-*`` nodes will alert for anything 10 or higher but the catchall
will allow for the remaining metrics to be checked without alerting for
worker nodes above 5
