def solve_parabola((ax, ay), (bx, by), (cx, cy)):
    '''
    y = a * x ^ 2 + b * x + c

    three pointers: (-1, 7), (1, 15), (-2, 9)
    we got three equations:
       7  = a  - b  + c
       15 = a  + b  + c
       9  = 4a - 2b + c
    then matrix A is:
       [[1, -1, 1], [1, 1, 1], [4, -2, 1]]

    matrix X is:
       [a, b, c]

    matrix B is:
       [[7], [15], [9]]
       
    Because AX = B, if we want got X, we should use equation:
       X = inverse(A) * B
    '''
    matrix_a = matrix([[pow(ax, 2), ax, 1], [pow(bx, 2), bx, 1], [pow(cx, 2),
                                                                  cx, 1]])
    matrix_b = matrix([[ay], [by], [cy]])

    return linalg.solve(matrix_a, matrix_b).tolist()
