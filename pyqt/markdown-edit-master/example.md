# Title top-level

## Subtitle

With some content, and multi-line paragraphs
containing _light_ formatting, and also weird
words with under_scores_within, and **heavy
emphasis**.

One separate paragraph, which shows partial
word high**light**, and ~~deletion~~ !

Also some `inline code` can be used, or even
big fenced piece of preformated text :

```
if (foo != 'bar') {
    do (42);
}
```

Can be useful, e.g on [GitLab](http://gitlab.org/)

## Another subtitle

Here we use some number literals like : 1 + 2 = 3

We also have ordered lists :

1. One,
2. Two...
3. Three !

And of course unordered bullets list :

* First level
    + Nested item
    + Yet another nested item
* Another first level
* And a last first level

And a nice ruler to separate things.

A table can be created easily :

| AND |  0  |  1  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  0  |  0  |  0  |
|  1  |  0  |  1  |
