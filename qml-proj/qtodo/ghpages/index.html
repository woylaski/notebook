<h1>Usage<a name="usage"></a></h1>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>On the first start no entries will be present. To add new entries simply click &quot;+&quot; in the toolbar. Please note: there are two types of text entries (For now, we skip sketches.) "to-dos" and "notes". To-dos can have subentries, notes don't.</p>

<h2>Subentries</h2>
<p>To-dos can have subentries. This way entries can be grouped logically. One use case is to create an overall task and define the subtasks as nested elements. Q To-Do allows an arbitrary depth of nested elements. The &quot;dot indicator&quot; in the titlebar shows the currently displayed level.</p>

<p>To navigate to subentries of a to-do mark the to-do and swipe from right to left. You should see the list move side-ways as you do it. Alternatively, you can click the small arrow button on the right side of a to-do entry. To navigate to the parent items simply swipe from left to right or click the arrow pointing to the left in the toolbar.</p>

<p>To add sub-entries to a new todo entry simply navigate to the list showing the sub-entries as described above. You will see an empty list. There you can then add new entries the same way you did before after Q To-Do was started for the first time.</p>

<h2>Progress Bar</h2>
<p>A "progress" bar indicates the progress of to-dos containing other to-dos. See also the screenshots above.</p>

<h2>Sketches</h2>
<p>It is possible to add simple sketches. To add a sketch press the button showing the pencil and drawing pictogram right of the &quot;+&quot; button in the toolbar.</p>

<p>In the to-do list view, sketches will be displayed downsized to a quarter of the original size (half width and half height). Sketches can be moved, edited, and deleted like all other elements.</p>

<h2>Reorder Entries</h2>
<p>To reorder entries use a two finger gesture. Select the entry you want to move, keep it pressed, and with a second finger move up or down.</p>

<h2>Double-click/Long-press</h2>
<p>Double-clicking an entry opens the edit field. Long-pressing opens a menu with more options.</p>

<h2>Synchronization</h2>
<p>Q To-Do offers a synchronization feature. With this synchronization feature it is possible to synchronize data between different Q To-Do instances. The probably most common use case for the synchronization feature is to synchronize to-dos between smartphones and desktop computers. However, synchronizing between different desktop computers, e.g., at home and at work, is also very handy.</p>

<p> The synchronization process is initiated via the main menu. There exist two options: synchronize the to-do list and synchronize the sketch files. It is recommended to first synchronize the to-do list and, if desired, synchronize the sketches afterwards. Please note that synchronizing the sketches is optional as it takes more time and requires more space. </p>

<p> Before the synchronization feature can be used some requirements must be fulfilled and settings need to be set up. Below are the instructions for setting up the synchronization functionality. </p>

<h3>General Requirements</h3>
<p> Q To-Do uses the IMAP protocol for its synchronization feature. IMAP is most commonly used in the context of e-mails. So, the basic requirement for using the Q To-Do synchronization functionality is an e-mail account with IMAP support. </p>

<h3> BlackBerry (BB10) Z10, Q10, and Q5, and Desktop (Linux, Windows) </h3>
<p> In oreder to be able to use the synchronization feature, the account details (server address, username, and password) need to be set up first.
To do this, open the menu in Q To-Do and choose the point &quot;Sync Account Settings&quot;. </p>

<p> To add a new account click &quot;New&quot;.
Then you can insert the account details.
The account name is a freely choosable name that is only used for identifying the account within Q To-Do.
The user name is the user name of your e-mail account, the password is the according e-mail account password and server is the address of the e-mail server you are using.
The other settings like port number etc. are already set to default values.
If you have problems logging in please notify me via e-mail.
I will try to assist you in this case. </p>

<p> Once you have finished entering the account details, click &quot;Save&quot;.
The newly created account should appear in the account list.
Select the newly created account and click &quot;OK&quot;. </p>

<p> I hope the pre-defined default values make sense for most e-mail providers out there.
If you happen to have issues with setting up the synchronization feature, feel free to contact me via e-mail. </p>

<h3>Nokia N9 (MeeGo/Harmattan)</h3>
<p> In order to use the synchronization feature on the Nokia N9 (MeeGo/Harmattan) it is required to set up an e-mail account that supports IMAP. This is done via the Nokia N9 accounts app. Once an e-mail account with support for the IMAP protocol was set up, the synchronization feature can be used out of the box. </p>

<p> In case you have multiple e-mail accounts with support for the IMAP protocol, you need to select one for synchronization.
To do this open the menu and click &quot;Sync Account Settings&quot;.
From the list select the account you want to use and press &quot;OK&quot;. </p>

<h2> Keyboard Interaction (Desktop Versions) </h2>
The desktop versions allow interaction via the keyboard. In the following the basic shortcuts are introduced.

<ul>
    <li>Navigating the List View: Arrow Keys (and h,j,k,l vi-like Bindings)</li>
    <li>Add a new entry: i or +</li>
    <li>Delete an entry: d</li>
    <li>Cancel an action: ESC</li>
    <li>Confirm an action: ENTER or RETURN</li>
    <li>Synchronize: CTRL+S</li>
    <li>Synchronize sketches: CTRL+SHIFT+S</li>
    <li>Clean items marked done: CTRL+C</li>
    <li>Global Shortcut to Toggle hide: CTRL+SHIFT+Y</li>
</ul>

<h2> System Tray Icon (Desktop Version) </h2>
<p> The desktop version has a system tray icon. With this icon Q To-Do can be easily hidden and shown via double-click. As another convenience functionality there is a global keyboard shortcut (CTRL+SHIFT+Y) to show/hide Q To-Do. </p>

<p> Furthermore, additional settings can be applied via the system tray icon, like forcing the window to stay on top (Linux and Windows version) or disabling the window borders (Linux version only). </p>
