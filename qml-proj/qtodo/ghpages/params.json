{"name":"Q To-Do","body":"### About\r\nQ To-Do is a simplistic todo organizer for MeeGo/Harmattan and Nemo/Mer. It features a clear, simplistic, and easy to use user interface that is optimized for multi-touch touch screens.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\nOn the first start no entries will be present. To add new entries simply click \"+\" in the toolbar. Please note: there are two types of entries \"todos\" and \"notes\". Todos can have subentries, notes don't.\r\n\r\nTo navigate to sub-entries of a todo simply swipe from right to left. You should see the list move side-ways as you do it. Alternatively, you can click the small button on the right side of a todo entry. To navigate to the parent items simply swipe from left to right or click the arrow pointing to the left in the toolbar.\r\n\r\nTo add sub-entries to a new todo entry simply navigate to the list showing the sub-entries as described above. You will see an empty list. There you can then add new entries the same way you did before after Q To-Do was started for the first time.\r\n\r\nA \"progress\" bar indicates the progress of todos containing other todos. See also the screenshots below.\r\n\r\nTo reorder entries use a two finger gesture. Select the entry you want to move, keep it pressed, and with a second finger move up or down.\r\n\r\nDouble-clicking an entry opens the edit field. Long-pressing opens a menu with more options.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nQ To-Do is currently available for MeeGo/Harmattan and Nemo/Mer. The MeeGo version can be downloaded from [app.formeego.org](http://apps.formeego.org/applications/n9/pr1.0/harmattan/Office/qtodo/) or [Nokia Store](http://store.ovi.com/content/269986).\r\n\r\nThe Nemo/Mer version is currently only available via my download repository. To add the repository and install Q To-Do open a shell and switch to the \"root\" user. As root type the following:\r\n```\r\nzypper ar http://repo.pub.meego.com/home:/wonko/CE_MW_MTF_CE_MW_Shared_armv7hl/home:wonko.repo\r\nzypper ref\r\nzypper up\r\n```\r\nNot that the repository is not signed yet. So you will be asked if you want to used an unsigned repository. Simply answer \"yes\" here.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n![Todo List](https://github.com/ruedigergad/qtodo/raw/master/ovi/list_screenshot_small.png)\r\n![Empty List](https://github.com/ruedigergad/qtodo/raw/master/ovi/empty_list_screenshot_small.png)\r\n![New Entry](https://github.com/ruedigergad/qtodo/raw/master/ovi/new_entry_screenshot_small.png)\r\n\r\n### License\r\nCopyright 2011, 2012 Ruediger Gad\r\n\r\nQ To-Do is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nQ To-Do is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
