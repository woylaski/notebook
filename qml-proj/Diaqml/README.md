# Diaqml

Very simply Diagram editor. Not intended to be a fully working application.
Just a try to get a bit deeper into QML

Currently it allows to:
 * create custom shape items dynamically on the scene *(via drag and drop from a list)*
 * move them around and resize them
 * change some properties *(color, text, border)*

# How to use it

Simply start it via:
qmlscene Diaqml.qml
