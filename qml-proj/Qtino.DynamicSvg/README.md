Qtino.DynamicSvg
==========

QtQuick plugin for dynamically modifying svg graphics from within qml.

Tested compatibility with Qt 5.3 (uses Qt private headers so compile against other versions at your own risk)

To use, just open the DynamicSvg.pro file in QtCreator and build for your target platform. It should automatically install to the default import directory for qml so you can immediately start using in your own Qt projects.

See the 'Examples' directory for API usage details.
